# Gradian
Gradian is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator](Parser Combinator) library for Java. It is based on Haskell's Parsec library, and the [https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond](arcsecond) node.js package.

## Naming
This library is named Gradian because of the naming of the node package it is based on, [https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond](arcsecond). Both an arcsecond and a gradian are (somewhat obscure) units of angle.
