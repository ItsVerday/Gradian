# Gradian
Gradian is a [Parser Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) library for Java. It is based on Haskell's Parsec library, and the [arcsecond](https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond) node.js package.

## What are Parser Combinators?
With parser combinator libraries, parsers are built up from smaller, simpler parsers. Parsers can be combined in a number of ways to produce more complex behavior. Gradian takes full advantage of this idea, providing a variety of "parser-combinators".

## Naming
This library is named Gradian because of the naming of the node package it is based on, [arcsecond](https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond). Both an arcsecond and a gradian are (somewhat obscure) units of angle.
